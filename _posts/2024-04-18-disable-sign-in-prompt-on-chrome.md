In in Chromium browsers there is a feature where a "Sign in as" is popped up on websites that can log in with an account.
This can be annoying so I looked around and found that in flags under chrome://flags OR if on Brave in brave://flags, there is a flag named "Enable Google Sign-In Permission Prompt" that turns this off, simply by setting the value to "Disabled" and after a relaunch of the browser the annoyance is gone!
